If your like me, you probable have a spice cabinet that is overflowing and is out of control.

This problem inspired a new 3D printed design. A customizable length spice rack shelf that could be 3D printed easily, using household /cheap materials.

This is by no means a new idea, if you look on Thingiverse, you’ll find a miriad of different spice rack/spice organizer designs that others have created, but I wanted to design something that could be printed on my small Monoprice Select Mini V2 printer as well as cheap and quick to produce.

After considering the various options for what material to make the “shelf” pieces out of I had a “eureka moment” and realized I could use paint stirring sticks. These are light weight, cheap if not free from most hardware stores and can support the minimal amount of weight required by spice cannisters/jars.

So I got to work designing in TinkerCad, and about an hour later, had my first version of the design. I sliced it up in Cura, and printed it out. 2 hours later, it was completed. Luckily, the paint sticks fit perfectly in the slots I had designed. I assembled it all together by pushing the paint sticks in the slots as seen below.

After assembling I was able to secure the organizer to the inside of my spice cabinet door with some hot glue. The spices fit well in the shelf, but there is a tiny bit of excess depth that I need to remove to allow them to fit more snuggly to avoid them falling out/shifting when I open the doors. But to my surprise, the design worked perfectly.

Since my first version, I removed the excess space from the end brackets and have started re-organizing my spice rack.

There are many customization options you can apply to this design as well. You can custom fit the length of the shelves to your space as needed (up to 12 inches/ max paint stick length). Additionally, you could paint or even stain the wooden paint sticks to match your aesthetics as you desire.

This design is free for anyone to use and download and can be found [here on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5237992).

Hope this encourages you to make something and build similar projects.
